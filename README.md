## Introduction
The repository contain the RTL design for the an In-memory computing unit that is capable of performing parallel addition and multiplication. Current design can load two vectors and is able to perform the arithemetic operations between them. This will accelerate the DSP opeations such as Convolution and reduction/accumulation, Dot product, Matrix Multiplication, min/max pooling which are the esential part of DNNs and CNNs
## Memory Array
<!-- Describe the standard cell design used in this project. -->

## Memory Vector
<!-- Explain the structure and functionality of the memory array. -->

## Memory Geometry
<!-- Outline the memory geometry, including details about cache slices, sub-arrays, and bitlines. -->

## Addition Operation
<!-- Describe the implementation of the addition operation based on the Neural Cache. -->

## Multiplication Operation
<!-- Provide details on how the multiplication operation is carried out using the Neural Cache approach. -->

## File Description
<!-- List and describe the files in the project repository. -->

## User Guide
<!-- Instructions on how to set up and use the project, including running the Verilog simulation. -->
